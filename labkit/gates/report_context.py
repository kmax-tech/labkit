    Attributes:
        area: The area, resolved.
        repo: Where the area's layout starts (`repo.layout_root`).
        protocol: The protocol file.
        text: The protocol as STATE holds it — the declaration is read here.
        head: Its TOML head.
        state: TREE, INDEX or PROPOSED.
        declared: The run the head declares as the reported result
            (`protocol_block.declared_run`, `[result] run`), None for an
            exploration — or for a `[result]` that does not read, which
            `declaration_gap` then names (a blocker: the commit must not
            carry it).
        declaration_gap: Why the declaration does not read, or None.
        run: The answering run (`audit_binding.audited_run`, through
            `answering_run.bound_answering_run`: the one choice every gate holds the
            protocol to), or None.
        why: Why there is no answering run, when RUN is None.
